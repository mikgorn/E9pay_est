# Small program for estimating certain values

## Description
This program allows you to estimate some values which increasing in exponential progression by defining 2 values in 2 separate dates. This method is not precise, as it is making pure mathematical function ignoring any other factors. Anyway, it is still giving pretty accurate predictions for a short time periods.
